.TH "KBDSCR" 1

.SH "NAME"
kbdscr \- show evdev button events graphically

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBkbdscr\fR layout input_event_evdev_path\&.\&.\&.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool displays button events from evdev devices in a configurable on-screen
layout. It is often useful for demos, screencasts, and debugging input devices\&.
.PP
This tool requires read access to the raw evdev devices to use this tool\&.
Usually, this means you need to be root or a member of the \fIinput\fR group.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fBlayout\fR
.RS 4
The keyboard layout to be displayed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBinput_event_evdev_path\fR
.RS 4
The path to an evdev device to watch. These are usually found in
/dev/input/event*\&. If there are any errors opening or reading from the device,
they will be shown as warnings, but will not cause kbdscr to exit\&.
.RE

.SH "LAYOUTS"
.PP
The following layouts were defined at the time kbdscr was compiled:

.SH "DEFINING NEW LAYOUTS"
.PP
To define new layouts, add them to \fIkbd_layout.h\fR by defining a macro which
calls \fIKBD_LAYOUT\fR. Then, add another entry to \fIKBD_LAYOUTS\fR with a
unique identifier (without spaces, generally starting with k- for keyboards, m-
for pointing devices, and km- for combinations), a human-readable description,
and a reference to the macro with the keyboard\&.
.PP
Each layout consists of the a base size, which is used for the row height in
pixels (keys spanning multiple rows are not supported), a number of units to
divide that size into, and the number of units wide each row is\&. Afterwards,
the keys and spacers are defined. Each key consists of the width, the text, and
it's evdev keycode (see \fIlinux/input-event-codes\&.h\fR). A spacer is the same
as a key, but without the text or keycode\&.
.PP
In the future, a textual format for specifying the layout at runtime may be
created if necessary\&.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
